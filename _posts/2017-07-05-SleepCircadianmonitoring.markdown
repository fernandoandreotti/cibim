<p align="justify">Getting a good night’s sleep is vital to cognitive functioning, protecting mental health, physical health and quality of life. Changes in sleep can be an indicator of severe changes to both mental and physical health. The science of sleep has recently emerged as a critical clinical discipline. Together with our partners at the recently established Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute (SCNi) we aim to advance our understanding of how sleep and circadian rhythm disruption impacts health.</p>

<p align="justify">Sleep disorders are currently diagnosed and monitored using polysomnographic (PSG) recordings, which records different physiological signals overnight such as the heart rate, respiration, EEG, and eye movement. Although PSGs are an important diagnostic tool in sleep medicine, the high costs and low comfort cause the sleep-related disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, sleep-wake cycle disorders, alteration in brain maturation...) to be under-diagnosed.  Our goal is to develop new signal and video processing routines that allow quantifying in a user-friendly and accurate way mental health and sleep anomalies.</p>

<p align="justify">Furthermore, sleep is of great importance in the preterm neonate monitoring, as sleep provides a biomarker to assess early brain maturation and cognitive development. Together with our partners at the University Hospital Leuven (UZ Leuven) and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) we develop machine learning methods and evaluate the relationship between sleep and cognition in neonates.</p>
