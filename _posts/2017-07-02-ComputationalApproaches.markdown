Fig. Tensor representation of EEG data

In our information era, the amount of data one has access to nowadays has tremendously increased in quantity and variety.  Problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern recognition, signal processing, and machine learning give rise to massive amounts of multidimensional and multimodal data with intrinsic high dimensionality.  This data is worth nothing by itself. The true value lies in the information that is potentially contained in the data. Data has to be mined in order to understand its underlying processes.

Fig. Tensor decomposition used in classification

In order to tackle big data analytics, we develop and optimise tools that efficiently process huge datasets. This can be done through smart designs of deep neural networks or by representing multidimensional data as tensors and extract underlying structure with tensor decompositions. These techniques enable state of the art pattern identification (e.g. gait in identifying Parkinson's patients), solve regression problems  (e.g. estimating blood pressure non-invasively from PPG signals), and classification (e.g. sleep staging).
