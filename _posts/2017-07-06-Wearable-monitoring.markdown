<p align="justify">Traditionally, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded with expensive hardware in a highly controlled lab environment. In order to enable brain monitoring in daily life situations, we built in collaboration with Stefan Debener from Oldenburg University a small, lightweight and wireless system that can be steered with Android software. This makes the concept of fully mobile EEG-based brain monitoring and real-life Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) very realistic. Mobile EEG is needed in various contexts, e.g. for long-term neurorehabilitation programs in home environments, for assessing listening effort or monitoring correlations of auditory attention in challenging listening environments to steer hearing devices, monitoring drowsiness, improving brain fitness in the elderly, etc. </p>

<p align="justify">One drawback of using traditional EEG caps in natural environments is that it attracts attention. Therefore, we focus research efforts on miniaturizing the mobile EEG device. A first prototype of a near-invisible high-quality brain monitoring device was developed in collaboration with Neuropsychology at the University of Oldenburg, CRITIAS (ETS, Montreal) and Sonomax, as shown in the figure. Such around-the-ear devices allow for continuous and reliable monitoring of brain activity and have the additional possibility to record vital signs in a convenient way.</p>

<p align="justify">Taking advantage of the ear canal's physical and physiological properties, ear-EEG is a very promising tool for unobtrusive and mobile monitoring of mental states. Inflatable earpieces can form a tight fit between the skin and the electrodes and this, combined with a behind-the-ear piece, has been used to record brain signals. Thanks to machine learning algorithms, features extracted from these recordings could enable innovative and wearable brain-computer interfaces. This project aims at measuring continuously and in real-time, the level of attention and concentration of an individual outside of a laboratory environment. Accessing this information could be used to prevent accidents by alleviating workload, for overwhelmed air traffic controllers for example, or by alerting drivers as they become too drowsy to react safely; it could also be used to adapt our portable devices' behaviour to our needs by restricting interruptions from calls, messages and notifications when a user is concentrating on a task, postponing their delivery to less productive moments in the day.</p>
