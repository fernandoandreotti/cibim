Getting a good night’s sleep is vital to cognitive functioning, protecting mental health, physical health and quality of life. Sleep is also important for recovery after diseases like stroke. Further, changes in sleep can be indicators of more severe changes to health, both mental and physical. 
The science of sleep has recently emerged as a critical clinical discipline and the goals of the recently established Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute (SCNi) are to advance our understanding of how sleep and circadian rhythm disruption impacts health.

Sleeping disorders are currently monitored and diagnosed using polysomnography, which records different physiological signals overnight such as the heart rate, respiration, EEG, and eye movement. 

Although polysomnography is important as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine, the high costs and low comfort cause the sleep-related disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea, sleep-wake cycle disorders, alteration in brain maturation...) to be under-diagnosed.  Our goal is to develop new signal and video processing routines that allow quantifying in a user-friendly and accurate way mental health and sleep anomalies.

Furthermore, sleep development in the preterm neonate is of continuing interest, as sleep provides a biomarker to assess early brain maturation and cognitive development.
