Fig. OxCAHT project implemented in Mumbai, India

<p align="justify">Together with the Oxford Centre for Affordable Healthcare (OxCAHT - http://oxcaht.org/) our group works on a number of projects involving the development of affordable engineering solutions to global health challenges. One such project focuses on childhood pneumonia. As the number one killer of children under the age of five, childhood pneumonia presents a serious public health challenge in low-resource settings. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the reduction of mortality but currently requires access to expert clinicians and advanced medical equipment. Leveraging the power of machine learning, we have been developing algorithms for more accurate and reproducible diagnosis, reliant only upon affordable point-of-care measurements. Additionally, we also work to automate the interpretation of relevant physiological signals, such as digital stethoscope recordings, deriving diagnostic information that is otherwise completely inaccessible for minimally trained health workers operating in low-resource settings. In early 2017 we launched a global health study in Mumbai, India, involving two implementation partners, Apnalaya and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital Mumbai, and having recorded physiological signals on >1,000 children suffering from a range of childhood disease. </p>
